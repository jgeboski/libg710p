A userspace library for interfacing with Logitech G710+ keyboards. This
library makes use of hidapi for interacting with the keyboard at the
HID level. While hidapi supports many other platforms, this has only
been tested on Linux, and will likely need work to run elsewhere.

There are two modes of operation provided by the hidapi: hidraw and
libusb. As a result, this library supports both modes via two different
libraries, much like hidapi. See the hidapi documentation for details.

## Building and Installing

The project uses Autotools, so the build and install process should be
fairly straight forward. If the error "Failed to open ..." is thrown,
ensure the running user has permission to read and write to the device
file.

    $ git clone https://github.com/jgeboski/libg710p.git
    $ cd libg710p
    $ ./autogen.sh --enable-tools
    $ make

Test locally:

    $ ./tools/g710p-keys

Install to the system:

    $ make install
    $ g710p-keys
